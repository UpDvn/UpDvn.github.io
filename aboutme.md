### My story

I started my programming journey in 2012 by creating very simple projects on Scratch. Over the years, I've slowly improved, and by now I'm able to write code in a wide variety of languages. I also occasionally do UI/UX design, music production, digital art, and game development on the side.

### Projects

Coming soon!
